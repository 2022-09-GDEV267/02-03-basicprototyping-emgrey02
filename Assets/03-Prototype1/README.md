# Get To The Other Side
This project is a display of what I have learned so far in Unity. Through making Roll-a-ball, Apple Picker, and Mission Demolition, I learned enough to make a game where a player can shoot obstacles and get to the other side as fast as they can. Some aspects of those games I included:
  - shooting a projectile which starts at a launch point (MD)
  - hitting a goal that is triggered by a collider w/ OnTriggerEnter (MD)
  - moving player with WASD (roll-a-ball)
  - using colliders to detect collisions w/ OnCollisionEnter (roll-a-ball)
  - destroying game objects using Destroy (AP)
  - using SetActive to activate/deactivate gameobjects (roll-a-ball)
  - limit physics on certain axes (AP)
  - control how layers interact with each other (AP)
  - camera follows player at set distance (roll-a-ball)
  - 3D (roll-a-ball)
  
  In addition I included:
  - particle systems
  - terrain
  - canvas as child of gameobject for healthbar
  - fire on click
  - probuilder shapes (tube, arch)
